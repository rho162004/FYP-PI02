# PI02 FYP @ NP
Hello!

This is the final compilation of code for PI02, by **Rebecca Hollis** and **Lai Puay Qi**.
Worked on with guidance by Mr. Loh Chin Fei and Mr. Tan Gu Yin. 

## Folders
### OpenCV
Original files provided by Mr. Loh for experimentation to learn the basics of OpenCV.   
WebcamStream_0p0.py is a demonstration of an application of this material.  
### Tkinter
Converted OpenCV provided files into Tkinter to learn the new library. Conversion done by Rebecca and Puay Qi.   
TK_Video_YOLO.py starts to look at using YOLO (machine learning object recognition)
### Loose files
**FINAL Last Sem GUI.py** - Changing framework of Sem 1 OpenCV.py to OOP and incorporating a GUI to it   
**FINAL Yolo_Timer** - YOLO framework, required download files for it to run is in dropbox  
**Sem 1 OpenCV.py** - Work from first sem predecessors  
**Untitled.png** - image needed for some tkinter, loose because unsure where   
**Video_ref1_yolo_0p0 ver2.py** - one of the earlier versions of YOLO  
**demo.py** - another YOLO  
**depth opencv.py** - code to try and estimate depth of objects in frame of two stereo cameras  
**screenshot.txt** - required for FINAL Yolo_Timer to run
